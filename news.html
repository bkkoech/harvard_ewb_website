Thus far, the chapter’s main source of revenue has been grants from Harvard University. This year, they  have strengthened their relationship with larger funding sources like the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Phillips Brooks House Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship, and the Harvard Global Health Institute. They have  been awarded one $8,000 and one $4,000 grant from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and $5,000 from the Harvard Office for Sustainability.  In addition, they have raised $8,615 during a winter fundraiser.
				</p>

				<p>
				The chapter plans to continue to apply for grants and pursue several corporate sponsorships with companies in the Boston area. They have assembled a sponsorship package to expose businesses to the project and encourage them to  donate. Possible corporate sponsors include Consigli Construction and Elaine Construction,  leading construction and construction management companies.  The chapter’s outreach centers around construction companies because the common engineering experiences they share with the chapter assist in the development of a robust relationship and enable in-kind donations.  Additionally, a relationship with the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard University is being pursued as the center has shown interest in the Los Sanchez project.

So far this year, they have finished a detailed analysis of possible designs for the water system. Some options that were considered included building another tank and using additional water sources to minimize piping costs and head loss do to long sections of piping. This analysis was submitted to EWB National and recently approved!
				</p>

				<p> Now the chapter is finalizing the the details of the chosen design.  They have completed models for a new well housing, a new valve box, and numerous tap stands. In addition, the team has used both excel and WaterGEMS to design a functional piping system that delivers water to the entire community!   The design has been submitted to EWB national and the chapter is anxiously waiting for approval!  Stay tuned for updates on our continued progress!
